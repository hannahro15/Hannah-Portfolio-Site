            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am mainly a self-taught developer originally coming from a musical background. I have gone through various online courses and bootcamps to enhance my skills.
                My non-technical experience is in music teaching, retail, customer service, libraries and administration.
            </p>
            <strong>Career Goals:</strong> I am currently seeking a front-end or front-end focused full stack developer role, or a position that leverages AI-assisted development tools.<br />

                <br />
                <ul>I also love working with visual and interactive projects, and I am very spatially oriented—my strength in jigsaw puzzles reflects my ability to see patterns and solve problems visually.</ul>
